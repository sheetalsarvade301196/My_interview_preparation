what is verticle scaling and horizontal scaling
horizontal scaling means adding more servers (or instances) to handle increased load, while vertical scaling means increasing the resources (CPU, RAM, etc.) of an existing server. Essentially, horizontal scaling adds more machines, while vertical scaling makes existing machines more powerful. 



what is RDS
a web service offered by Amazon Web Services (AWS) that simplifies the process of setting up, operating, and scaling relational databases in the cloud.
It provides a cost-effective and resizable capacity for industry-standard relational databases while automating common database administration tasks.

how RDS is managed 

what is route53
 It essentially acts as the internet's phonebook, translating human-readable domain names (like www.example.com) into the numerical IP addresses that computers use to connect to each other. Route 53 also offers features like domain registration, DNS routing, and health checking.
